## 🧪 Local Testing

Run the app locally:

```bash
Then test via console or send POST requests to:
http://localhost:8080/telex/webhook

Sample payload:
{
  "text": "What should I wear today?"
}
```

## 🌐 Deployment
Deploy to a public HTTPS endpoint using:
- Render
- Railway
- Google Cloud Run
  Ensure your webhook is reachable at:

```
https://your-app.com/telex/webhook
```

## 🔗 Telex.im Integration
1. Invite Yourself
   Run this in Telex chat:
```
/telex-invite your-email@example.com
```

2. Register Workflow
   Create a Mastra workflow JSON like:
```
{
  "name": "fashion_agent",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "fashion_node",
      "name": "Fashion Agent",
      "type": "a2a/mastra-a2a-node",
      "typeVersion": 1,
      "url": "https://your-app.com/telex/webhook",
      "position": [100, 200]
    }
  ],
  "description": "Suggests outfits based on weather",
  "category": "lifestyle",
  "active": true
}
```

Upload it to Mastra or register via API.
